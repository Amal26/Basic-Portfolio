              <p>Hello! My name is Amal (pronounced as Jamal without the J), which means “hope” in Arabic.
               I’m twenty-six years old and trying to figure out what I want in life.
               I was raised in Stockholm, Sweden and moved to Minnesota six years ago, and I’m still getting used to this place. 
               I love to travel and try food from different countries, even though I get dizzy when I eat spicy food.
               My favorite dish so far is Turkish Kebab with rice.</p>
              <p>I love to play and watch soccer, ski, and swim. I also like animals, if they’re not ants or dangerous enough to kill me.
               When I said I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do, I meant it.
               I have changed my major at least four times, but I think I finally know which direction I want to go.
               Hey, at least that’s a step. I’m currently a manager at a daycare. 
               Dealing with kids got me questioning whether I want to have children on my own, but I’ve also learned how to be VERY patient.</p>
